Publication
======
* He Wang\*, **Yezhen Cong**\*, Or Litany, Yue Gao and Leonidas J. Guibas. 3DIoUMatch: Leveraging IoU
  Prediction for Semi-Supervised 3D Object Detection. *Accepted to 2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2021)*. [link](https://thu17cyz.github.io/files/3dioumatch.pdf)

Research Experience and Projects
======
**Stanford University, Computer Science Department, Apr. 2020 – Nov. 2020**\
*Research Assistant to Prof. [Leonidas J. Guibas](https://geometry.stanford.edu/member/guibas/), ACM fellow, IEEE fellow*\
**3DIoUMatch: Leveraging IoU Prediction for Semi-Supervised 3D Object Detection**
* Proposed a novel semi-supervised method for 3D object detection based on pseudo-label propagation
along with a carefully designed filtering mechanism; This method outperformed the prior art significantly
under all settings on the two major indoor object detection benchmarks, ScanNet and SUNRGB-D
* Proposed leveraging predicted 3D IoU as localization confidence for pseudo-label filtering for the first time
in both 2D and 3D semi-supervised object detection to improve the localization quality of pseudo-labels
* Devised a differentiable 3D IoU module that enabled our localization filtering, IoU-guided NMS and IoU
optimization for bounding box refinement, and predicted IoU more accurately than previous designs
* Submitted a paper as joint first author, currently under review

**Tsinghua University, School of Software, Apr. 2019 – Nov. 2019**\
*Research Assistant to Assoc. Prof. [Yue Gao](http://www.gaoyue.org/en/people/gaoyue_index.html)*\
**PointAlign: Towards Rotation Invariant Point Cloud Representation via Tangent Space Alignment**
* Proposed a method of hierarchically aligning point cloud to local tangent space, which could be easily
applied to multiple mainstream point cloud networks and make them invariant to arbitrary rotation.
* With our add-on method, RS-CNN could reach 90.8% classification accuracy under random SO(3) rotation
compared to 31.4% without our method on ModelNet40, outperforming the prior art remarkably
* Participated in Academic Promotion Program at Tsinghua University and awarded Outstanding Oral
Presentation. Submitted a paper to CVPR 2020 as joint first author

**Tsinghua University, School of Software, Nov. 2018 – Feb. 2019**\
*Research Assistant to Assoc. Prof. [Yue Gao](http://www.gaoyue.org/en/people/gaoyue_index.html)*\
**Visual Object Recognition**
* Studied how to learn joint representation of multimodal data for object recognition; Designed and
implemented several methods of fusing point cloud data and multi-view image data
* Won the First Prize in Scientific Research Training Program of School of Software, Tsinghua University

**WeChat Mini-Program Development Competition 2020 [\[link\]](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/community/competition), May. 2020 – Aug. 2020**\
*Supervised by Assoc. Prof. [Qiang Liu](http://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/soften/3131/2010/20101219111048022743576/20101219111048022743576_.html)*
* Designed a creative, playable and user-friendly WeChat Mini-Game called Yin-Yang with a classmate
* Implemented the game in JavaScript using Cocos Engine; Created the art resources ourselves with online resources and Photoshop; Improved the smoothness and speed of the game by using techniques such as resource preloading and node pool recycling
* Won the First Prize (4/171); Contacted by a game company for possible cooperation

**Kaggle Open Images 2019 – Visual Relationship [\[link\]](https://www.kaggle.com/c/open-images-2019-visual-relationship), Aug. 2019 – Oct. 2019**\
*Supervised by Assoc. Prof. [Yue Gao](http://www.gaoyue.org/en/people/gaoyue_index.html)* 
* To provide high quality bounding boxes for detecting visual relationship, surveyed and compared many state-of-the-art 2D detectors; Preprocessed the raw data for training the detectors
* Inspired by several key improvements in SOTA detection methods, refined my own detection network based on YOLOv3 and obtained higher-quality bounding boxes, which improved the visual relationship detection performance, helping our team win Silver Medal
